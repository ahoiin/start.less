# start.less v0.1

Start.less is a lightweight (14kb) style library for web apps.
It is perfect to start with a webapp or just create a fast app-prototype.
Start.less is based on a responsive layout, you can use several offered webfonts for your icons and customize your app easily with the included .less files.
Start.less is created and maintained by [Sebastian Sadowski](https://twitter.com/ahoiin) from [AppGestalt](http://www.appgestalt.com).
